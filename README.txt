I implemented the Apriori algorithm with Python. The packages needed to run this program are the common packages (pandas, numpy, and itertools). To run the Apriori algorithm, run the second cell of code first to define what the function is, then run the last cell to start running the algorithm. The inputs of the algorithm are dataset name, minimum support value, and output txt file name.
